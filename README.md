## Scripts
<b>assembly.md</b> describes the K-mer analysis and genome assembly of the <i>P. recurvata</i> reference genome.

<b>annotation.md</b> describes the structural and functional annotation of genes in the <i>P. recurvata</i> reference genome assembly. 

<b>synteny_analysis.md</b> describes the analysis of synteny among the <i>P. recurvata</i> chromosomes and also between the <i>E. plantagineum</i> reference chromosomes.

<b>chloroplast_assembly.md</b> describes the assembly of the <i>P. recurvata</i> reference chloroplast genome. 

## Data Availability
The raw genomic sequences (SRR29849658), genome assembly (JBHHJY000000000), and plant tissue sample description (SAMN42375859) are available under the NCBI bioproject PRJNA1133066. Raw transcriptomic sequences (SRR30591463) are linked to the same bioproject. The chloroplast genome assembly is included in the full genome assembly. The structural annotation and functional annotation (with GO terms) are available [here].
